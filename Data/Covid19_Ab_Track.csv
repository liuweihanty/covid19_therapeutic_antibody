The agreement with AstraZeneca allows VVC to continue working with other partners to develop antibodies for diagnostic and therapeutic applications.
  The spike protein on the SARS-CoV-2 virus is the primary target being explored for potential COVID-19 monoclonal antibodies. The aim is that by targeting the spike protein, the antibody will be able to neutralise the SARS-CoV-2 virus and affect its capacity to infect healthy cells. 
  AstraZeneca is harnessing its proprietary immune replica technology, developed as part of the abovementioned agreement with DARPA, which can capture and screen antibodies from millions of primary B cells. The company is also utilising hybridoma technology, which is a method for producing large numbers of monoclonal antibodies through a culture of hybrid cells that results from the fusion of B cells and immortal myeloma cells.
  Once identified, the monoclonal antibodies are screened against their ability to bind to the spike protein before further developability tests are carried out. AstraZeneca is aiming for clinical evaluation in the next 3 to 5 months. In addition to internal research and development, AstraZeneca is collaborating with government and academic experts to evaluate additional promising candidates for future clinical use.

  Ossianix wishes to partner after this screening stage with interested parties in government, academia or biotech and pharma companies to develop the virus blocking VNAR antibodies and move the project to a therapeutic reality in the shortest possible time. A novel approach being pioneered at Ossianix uses its patented VNAR phage display libraries to identify single domain antibodies with high affinity and specificity against the COVID-19 spike protein. The spike protein is the site of attachment of the virus with its cellular receptor ACE-2 and blockade at that site will neutralize its activity.
  
  Single domain VNAR antibodies have large CDR3 binding domains that preferentially bind cavities and buried epitopes in proteins. These are often the sites of protein-protein interactions. It is thus highly likely that screening of the multi-isoform and[HKC1] highly complex VNAR libraries will identify hits that will be different from those isolated from human B cells. Once identified, VNAR single domain antibodies can then be developed to block these sites. Certain VNAR antibodies that bind to the transferrin receptor have also shown the capability to specifically target the lung in rodents and non-human primates.

  ACE-MABTM is a proprietary bi-specific fusion protein that binds to the spike protein of coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, which is expected to block SARS-CoV-2 from binding and infecting respiratory epithelial cells or ACE2-expressing cells to interrupt the viral life cycle -- ACE-MAB is in the cGMP cell line development stage by our strategic partner, Mabpharm Limited, and could be ready for large-scale production in Mabpharm’s 30,000 m2 cGMP facilities in China for human clinical trials and commercialization upon receipt of requisite regulatory approvals -- Sorrento has been granted an exclusive license to develop and commercialize the ACE-MAB product candidate in the North American and European markets. Designed as a bi-specific fusion protein, ACE-MAB has two functional arms. One arm (Ab) is a fully human antibody that targets the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 with high affinity. The other arm (TR) is a truncated ACE2 protein that binds to a different epitope of the spike protein. The ACE-MAB fusion protein could also block the receptor binding domain (RBD) with CD147 to mitigate lung inflammation and cytokine storm. The dual-arm design could be a unique advancement, potentially providing binding to the SARS-CoV-2 virus that is sufficient to prevent the virus from invading normal human cells. ACE-MAB retains the ACE2 enzymatic function, which could provide benefits such as reduced vasoconstriction and increased blood flow to infected lung tissue. The ACE2 arm competes with RBD binding to respiratory epithelial or other cells. It should preserve the ACE2 enzymatic activity, which is important in maintaining normal blood pressure and healthy blood flow into patients with infected lung tissue, which would include patients with advanced COVID-19 disease.","http://investors.sorrentotherapeutics.com/news-releases/news-release-details/sorrento-collaborates-mabpharm-development-and-commercialization

73,63,1,OstriGen SARS-CoV-2 mAbs,S protein,Preclinical,Ostrich Pharma USA (http://www.ostrigen.com/),,,,,,"MARCH 31, 2020: Ostrich Pharma USA has announced the successful development of ostrich antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the expanding use of those antibodies in Japan, and plans for producing and deploying the antibodies in the U.S. Dr. Yasuhiro Tsukamoto, Dean of the Graduate School of Life and Environmental Sciences at Kyoto Prefectural University and Co-CEO of Ostrich Pharma USA, has injected a genetically engineered pseudovirus into ostriches, and antibodies were purified from their eggs. These antibodies demonstrate a strong ability to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 viruses. Dr. Tsukamoto said: ""We have produced ostrich antibodies to many viruses, bacteria, and allergens, but we were pleased to see how quickly the ostriches developed immunity and placed the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in their eggs. We were even more pleased to see how capable the antibodies were in blocking the virus that causes COVID-19.""
  Ten ostriches have been vaccinated, and the antibodies from their eggs have already been used in masks, nasal drops, and candies in Japan. Masks with antibody-impregnated liners have been proven to block 99.9% of influenza viruses. More than 70 medical institutions in Japan have purchased large numbers of ostrich antibody masks to prevent infections among healthcare workers, and the order rate is increasing. The Rinku Medical Clinic, a cancer hospital in Osaka, Japan, has begun a clinical trial on the use of ostrich antibody nasal drops to prevent hospital-acquired coronavirus infection. If a patient infected with SARS-CoV-2 is present, a doctor will spray the antibody solution into the nasal cavity of hospitalized patients, close contacts, and healthcare professionals. According to Dr. Takahiro Ishikawa, President of the Rinku Medical Clinic, ""In the absence of vaccines and therapeutics, proving that the ostrich antibody nasal drops have a preventive effect could be a real breakthrough.""
  Dr. Tsukamoto’s research also encompasses the study of the ostrich antibodies as a therapeutic. He and his research team have published results showing one hundred per cent efficacy of H5N1 (avian influenza) antibodies injected into chickens infected with the avian influenza virus. To reduce potential rejection after inoculation into humans, Dr. Tsukamoto is developing an antibody drug that uses various enzymes to cut ostrich antibody molecules into smaller molecules containing antigen-binding regions.
  According to Ostrich Pharma USA Co-CEO Stuart Greenberg, ""We recognize the enormous need for multiple approaches to the COVID-19 pandemic in the US. In order to be a participant in this war, we will need to immunize large numbers of ostriches, purify large amounts of the antibodies from the ostrich eggs, and get manufacturing capacity to make products, like masks. We will need to develop an approach to marketing, including defining the regulatory path, when appropriate. We expect to team with some key partners to accomplish this.""
  Ostrich Pharma USA, under the trade name “OstriGen,” is exploiting the powerful immune system of the ostrich to develop a revolutionary class of treatments and prophylaxes that are highly effective and economical.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ostrich-pharma-usa-produces-antibodies-203900885.html,5/18/2020,X.X

J Immunol 2001 Mar 1;166(5):3599-605. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.166.5.3599.). Implicit Bioscience conducted a small NIH-funded pilot trial of IC14 treatment in 13 patients with ARDS, which suggested that IC14 treatment reduced alveolar inflammation and decreased BAL cytokines. IC14 was also the subject of IND 105803 for a phase 2 study of ARDS from all causes which the company proposes to revise for the COVID-19 indication.",,5/18/2020,

All 6 of these patients showed an early resolution of fever and improvement in oxygenation within 1-3 days, none of the patients progressed to require mechanical ventilation, and 3 of the patients were discharged from the hospital within 5 days. Mavrilimumab was well-tolerated.
  An additional 7 non-mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and hyperinflammation have since been treated with mavrilimumab. The results from these patients are consistent with the first 6 patients treated. One of the 7 patients was electively intubated and subsequently returned to low-level supplemental oxygen. All 13 patients improved clinically, and 12 out of 13 patients returned home.
  Kiniksa has engaged with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and is preparing for a potential registrational development program for mavrilimumab in COVID-19 pneumonia and hyperinflammation. In parallel, academic investigators in the U.S. and Italy are planning investigator-initiated placebo-controlled studies.
